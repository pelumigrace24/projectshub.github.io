									<h2><a href="#">Unilever Canteen Ordering System</a></h2>
									<p> A unique project aimed at ensuring that the employees of Unilever enjoyed a seamless lunch break. In the previous analysis of the canteen management system of Unilever,
										It was discovered that the time employees spend getting a meal from the canteen was a significant part of the disruption to work being done in the organisation, and there was an increased waste of about 30% daily from the canteen.
										This anomaly affected employees' productivity and increased wastage in the canteen management. Therefore, change was needed.
										As a Business Analyst and Team Lead for this project, I collaborated with a team to design and implement a Canteen Ordering System at Unilever, 
										which was intended to enhance employee satisfaction and operational efficiency.
										The system provides Unilever with numerous significant advantages by simplifying the meal ordering process, thereby leading to enhanced efficiency, Time Optimization, Cost Control and Payroll Integration,
										Data-Driven Decision-Making and Improved Employee Experience.</p>
